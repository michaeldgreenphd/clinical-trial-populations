"""Advance the geography tab to a new contract run — the deliberate act.

    python3 scripts/geo/advance_run.py /path/to/geo_rep_YYYY-MM-DD_runNNN

What it does, in order:
  1. refuses a run whose RUN_INFO.csv status is not `final`
  2. hash-verifies the 12 contract files against the run's own MANIFEST.csv
  3. stages them byte-for-byte into data/geo/<run_id>/
  4. rewrites data/geo/active_run.json (the pin)
  5. regenerates tests/run_expectations.json from the newly staged table and
     prints an old→new summary of every expectation that moved

It deliberately does NOT commit anything. Review the diff — especially the
expectations summary and the caveat prose the tests will now check — then
commit and open a PR; the geo-contract-tests workflow re-runs the acceptance
tests on the new pin. Nothing reads geo_rep_LATEST.txt.

Which repository this lives in, and why
--------------------------------------
This script belongs to the SITE repository (clinical-trial-populations), not
to civicsample-engine, because every path it writes is a site path: it stages
into data/geo/<run_id>/, rewrites data/geo/active_run.json, and regenerates
tests/run_expectations.json, all resolved from REPO below (the repository
this file sits in). Running a copy that lives in the engine repo would stage
the run into the engine's working tree, where nothing serves or tests it.
The engine keeps only the *watcher* (geo-snapshot-watcher.yml), which opens an
advisory issue when AACT publishes a newer snapshot and touches nothing.

The expectations file records what THIS run's numbers are so the acceptance
tests can assert the app renders them faithfully. It is generated from the
same table the app reads, so it cannot catch a pipeline regression by itself —
that is the pipeline's own cross-check suite's job (a_/b_cross_checks, b2/b3
in the run directory). What it does catch: the app drifting from the table,
and any value change being silently invisible in review.
